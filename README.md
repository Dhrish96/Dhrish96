>These are some of my academic projects:
- Data Science
1. Wine Quality Analysis: The project consisted of applying machine learning algorithms to examine the quality of red and white wines. The main aim of the project was to understand and apply machine learning concepts, data analysis, and model evaluation techniques. The dataset was selected, and preprocessed, training was done using machine learning model(s), performance was evaluated and the findings were summarized.
2. Data Science Book Recommender: The objective of the project was to develop a _Shiny app for book recommendation_ based on the provided dataset which was obtained from **Kaggle**. The Book Recommender app offers users a curated list of the top 10 books based on their entered keyword(s). Users received a tailored list of the highest-rated books that match their search criteria based on the submitted keyword(s).

- Electronics and Communication
1. Fall Detector for the Elderly: The main aim was to detect when a fall occurs using an accelerometer that detects and sends messages to the caretaker and ambulance services to provide emergency medication. The RFID reader and RFID card module present in the circuit helps to know the medical history of the patient. GSM module alerts the required authorities.
2. Lexicon: A Smart Wearable Gadget for the disabled: The project's main aim was to produce recognition of hand gestures with accuracy. The MEMS sensor will detect hand motions. The data glove also enables impaired people to switch appliances On and Off as desired. Two main modules included were: One for identifying sign boards and the other for automatic recognition of predefined logos.
