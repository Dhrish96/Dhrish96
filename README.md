>These are some of my academic projects:
1. Fall Detector for the Elderly: The main aim was to detect when a fall occurs using an accelerometer that detects and sends messages to the caretaker and ambulance services to provide emergency medication. The RFID reader and RFID card module present in the circuit helps to know the medical history of the patient. GSM module alerts the required authorities.
2. Lexicon: A Smart Wearable Gadget for the disabled: The project's main aim was to produce recognition of hand gestures with accuracy. The MEMS sensor will detect hand motions. The data glove also enables impaired people to switch appliances On and Off as desired. Two main modules included were: One for identifying sign boards, the other for automatic recognition of predefined logos.
