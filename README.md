>These are some of my academic projects:
1. Fall Detector for the Elderly: The main aim was to detect when the fall occurs using an accelerometer which detects and sends message to the caretaker and ambulance services so that the emergency medication can be provided. The RFID reader and RFID card module present in the circuit helps to know the medical history of the patient. GSM module alerts the required authorities.
2. Lexicon: A Smart Wearable Gadget for the disabled: The main aim of the project was to produce recognition of hand gestures with accuracy. The hand motions will be detected by the MEMS sensor. The data glove also enables the impaired person to switch appliances On and Off as desired. Two main modules included were: One for identifying sign boards, the other for automatic recognition of predefined logos.
